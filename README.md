Books App
====================

This is a non-runnable code of a Book Search application. I spent a bit less than 3 hours on it, my main goal was to show how I see application design.

Information
---------

* I didn't use any frameworks, all code is written by me.
* I didn't write unit tests, I tried to write as much code as I could to show the software design.
* There is no html part, I focused on backend code.
* SQL structure of the tables is given in the file schema.sql
